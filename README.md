# shoppingcarthtmljs

this can be added to an html webpage to demonstrate the ability to pick and choose what you wish to have on a website. It can also be used freely due to the MIT license's nature.
feel free to use this syntax in your website and set your own parameters. 

This is used in a .JSX format so remember that you need that set in that file in for this code to work.
Happy coding
